# The Sheercleft Local Area
Sheercleft is a small mining settlement of a few hundred souls built around the top of the Sheercleft Ravine, the sides of which are rich with valuable ore. The ravine runs north-west to south-east between four mountains and Sheercleft has been built in a round basin the surrounds a stretch of it. The ravine runs directly through the middle of this basin, splitting Sheercleft into two half. The easterly side of the village is referred to as Shamleyside and contains most of the residential buildings, whereas the western side of the basin, known as Quenlan Row, is dedicated to the supporting the workings of the mine and houses administrative and industrial buildings. The mining equipment itself surrounds the ravine on both sides.

To the north of of Sheercleft the mountains extend into dwarven territory. Dwarven society consists of largely independent Holds, each ruled by its own Lord. These Lords, in theory, all answer to the Dwarven High King. However, it is rare for the the King to interfere with the inner workings of another Hold. Some Holds are small villages built into the side of a mountain, while the major Holds are vast subterranean cities. The dwarves worship a pantheon of gods known as the Morndinsamman, chief amongst whom is the god Moradin.

West of Sheercleft the mountains eventually give way to the vast and ancient Eldren forest. This is the most centralised seat of elven civilisation in all of Arden, insofar as one exists at all. This part of the world is wild and brims with natural energy. The walls between the material plane and the feywild wear especially thin here.

East lies the human kingdom of Breanne. Breanne is a feudal nation ruled by a King who is supported by the noble houses. These in turn each control one of the major duchies. Breanne is known for its knights and its primary religious figure is a river goddess who most simply refer to as "The Lady". It was nobles from Breanne who originally founded Sheercleft.

The lands south of Sheercleft are wild and untamed. Orc tribes, giantkin and other menaces roam these frigid stormy mountains and far to the south wild human barbarians raid the coastline.
